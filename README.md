# text_adventure_test
Building a basic text adventure to see how many easy it is and if it's something I should spend more time on.

Lets make some boxes and set up basic stats!
Face and name were computer generated, Red dots were health and green is sanity.
Scroll was just a cash shop, gear is settings, and the stats, when clixked give you info on said stat.
The book at the bottom was a log ofthings done and see. Treasure box is in-game currency, trophy is the leader bord.
Time to build a map function forthe stats so I don't have to build every div.
